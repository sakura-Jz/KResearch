**--- MANDATORY REPORT STRUCTURE & INSTRUCTIONS ---**

You must generate a report that strictly adheres to the following structure and guidelines. Each section must be clearly delineated with the specified markdown headings.

# [Create a Formal and Descriptive Title for the Report]

## 1. Executive Summary
*   Start with a high-level overview.
*   Concisely state the original research objective.
*   Summarize the most critical findings and conclusions drawn from the entire research process.
*   End with a brief statement on the strategic implications.
*   This section must be a dense, polished summary of the entire document.

## 2. Introduction and Methodology
*   **Introduction:** Restate the refined research problem from the \`<REQUIREMENT>\`. Explain the report's purpose and what it aims to achieve.
*   **Scope:** Clearly define the boundaries of the research. What was included and what was intentionally excluded?
*   **Methodology:** Describe the research process. Mention the use of a multi-agent AI system, iterative search cycles using Google Search, and synthesis of information from multiple sources. Explain that the research was dynamic and adaptive based on emerging findings.

## 3. Thematic Analysis of Findings
*   This is the core of the report. It must be detailed and extensive.
*   Synthesize information from the \`<LEARNINGS>\` block AND the attached file content into a thorough, coherent analysis.
*   Organize findings into distinct thematic sections (e.g., "Market Trends," "Technological Advancements," "Competitive Landscape"). Use \`###\` for sub-headings for each theme.
*   For each theme, provide in-depth analysis, supported by the data gathered. Do not just list facts; interpret them.
*   Where applicable, discuss contrasting viewpoints or conflicting data found during the research.

## 4. Strategic Implications and Recommendations
*   Based *exclusively* on the findings in the previous section, deduce the strategic implications for the target audience.
*   If relevant, perform a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis.
*   Provide a set of clear, actionable recommendations. Each recommendation should be justified by the research findings.

## 5. Future Outlook and Areas for Further Research
*   Discuss the likely future trajectory of the topic based on your analysis.
*   Identify any unanswered questions that emerged during the research.
*   Suggest specific areas where further, more targeted research could provide additional value.

## 6. Conclusion
*   Provide a strong, concise final summary of the report.
*   Reiterate the most important takeaways and their significance.
*   End with a powerful concluding thought.

**--- STYLE AND FORMATTING ---**
*   **Tone:** Formal, objective, authoritative, and analytical.
*   **Data Visualization:** Where appropriate, use Mermaid.js charts (e.g., flowcharts, mind maps, Gantt charts) to visually represent complex relationships, processes, or timelines. Embed them in the relevant sections.
*   **Formatting:** Use Markdown extensively for clarity (headings, lists, bold text).
*   **Exclusivity:** The report's content must be based **exclusively** on the information provided in the prompt context. Do NOT invent information or use outside knowledge. Do NOT include inline citations.

**Final Output:** Respond ONLY with the raw markdown content of the final report, starting with the H1 Title.
